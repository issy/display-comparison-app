# 🖥️ Display Comparison Tool

This is a web tool designed to help you visually compare the physical sizes and shapes of different computer monitors, TVs, or other screens.

It allows you to input the diagonal size and aspect ratio (like 16:9 or 21:9) for multiple screens and see them overlaid on top of each other.

## 🚀 How to Use

Add Screens: Click the "Add Screen" button to start a new configuration.

Define Dimensions: For each screen, enter:

Diagonal (in): The advertised screen size (e.g., 27).

Aspect Ratio (X:Y): The ratio of width to height (e.g., 16 and 9).

Calculate: Click the main Calculate & Update Comparison button.

Analyse:

The "Visual Comparison" section shows the different screens stacked, demonstrating which screen is taller, wider, or larger overall.

The table at the bottom of the page provides exact numerical measurements.
